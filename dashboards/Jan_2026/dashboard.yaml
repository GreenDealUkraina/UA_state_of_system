about: Green Deal Ukraïna (GDU) is a German, Ukrainian, and Polish project that aims to support Ukraine in making future-proof energy and climate policy decisions. It is funded by the German Ministry of Research, Technology, and Space (BMFTR). The three main work streams are data & modelling, policy advice, and capacity building. In addition, GDU contributes to the development of the newly established Kyiv Energy and Climate Lab in Ukraine.

    bullets:
      - Prior to February 2022, Ukraine was a net electricity exporter, integrated within the IPS/UPS system.
      - After full invasion, synchronization with ENTSO-E in early 2022 was accompanied by a loss of imports from Belarus.
      - Strong import surge occured in mid-2024 (over 1.5 TWh/month) to cover domestic shortfalls after Russian attacks in spring 2024.
      - Following  capacity repairs in 2024, imports stabilised, declined and net exports restarted from mid-2025 onwards.
      - Import dependency rises again in October 2025 following further attacks by Russia. December 2025 saw highest volume of imports since January 2025.
      - January 2026 saw the highest volume of commerical power imports since the start of the war.

    bullets:
      - Conventional plants have been repeatedly subject to attacks by Russia, damaging the already old, inefficient infrastructure. 
      - Destruction from attacks in October 2025 mainly affected CHPs, and infrastructure at DSO level, such as transformers.
      - Due to occupation and destruction, renewable energy capacity fell from 9.6 GW (January 2022) to 7.4 GW in October 2025. 
      - November 2025 attacks have hit coal-plants particularly hard, dropping available conventional capacity below 13 GW for the first time since April 2024. 
      - Repairs over the last month have restored around 1.4 GW of net capacity (majority thermal) when accounting for more recent attacks in December/January.
      - Recent statements from the former CEO of Ukrenergo suggest available conventional capacity is closer to 11 GW.

    title: Gas storage reserves

    note: Excluding technical gas
    source: Aggregated Gas Storage Inventory (AGSI)
    bullets:
      - Excluding technical gas, storage levels were refilled from less than 1000 mcm in May 2025 to around 8600 mcm by November 2025.
      - If daily gas consumption and production in 2026 follow the same trends as 2025 (in terms of absolute volumes in mcm), just under 4000 mcm would be left in storage by the end of the heating season.
      - This marks an improvement compared to the same period in early 2025, suggesting that repairs to domestic production facilities have been largely successful.
      - Despite online rumours that the recent Oreshnik missile attack targeted gas storage, no damage was reported.

      - Prices reflect market conditions under winter demand and ongoing infrastructure disruptions.
